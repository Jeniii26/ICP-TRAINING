Common Exercise

The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.

Burpee
Burpees are a great, full bosy exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Bein in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump back from a squatted position.

Plank
Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.

Mountain Climber
Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch  as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
